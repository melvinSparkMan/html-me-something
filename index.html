    Melvin Sparkman: The story behind the man.
    </h2>
    <div>
        When I set out to write and publish this page, I had to ask the question; what is the difference between my bio and my resume? I believe my fellow classmates and young TA's could benefit immensely from these few words of widsom.
    <br><br>  
        It's not quite apparent when you embark upon a career, however you'll find numerous other objects revovling around you and very dependent on each other, such as marriage, children, career development and graduate degrees.
    <br><br>
        However, as you near the end and perhaps maybe even deceased, how are they remembering you and what are you being called? Were you Mr. John Smith the Director of the Chamber of Commerce or were you Dabney "Red Code" Hollingsworth the Renowned Developer who derived Autonomy out of Artificial Intelligence? That's when you know if your biography or your resume defined you.
    <br><br>
    
        I can tell you without question that my biography has been bland at best.
    <br><br>
        Grew up in a small town, a <a href="images/photo_1.html"> skinny weasely little kid</a> in grade school with the only item of note, my time on the flag football team. The next five years everything was fast-forwarded. Played real football, had a real job and found myself in the <a href="images/photo_2.html">Marine Corps</a> real fast.

    <br>
        Quite frankly, time had never stood still thereaafter nor since. There were a few education endeavours across multiple locations in the U.S. In terms of work, I worked in Minnesota, Massachusetts and California. I've traveled to and through nearly every state in the Union. Alaska, Idaho, Montana and South Dakota remain on the bucket list. I've spent a few years in Asia and I've worked in Europe.
    <br><br>
        I had never traveled to nor visited Missouri, however, in 2015 I did make the unconscionable decision to move to Missouri sight unseen. My time here has been a series of cascading disappointments and setbacks, but I don't regret the move. Staying in California could have been worse.
    <br><br>
        Being affiliated with the AARP Foundation and LaunchCode has felt much like an upward trajectory and I have a good feeling about my next career move.
    <br><br>
        I didn't see LaunchCode coming, however, two years ago I attended a number of Job Fairs and there were these recruiters and representatives from the various Web Development and Coding schools walking around approaching people and giving out brochures. The common theme among these schools were the hefty tuitions. At the time I had the desire to learn Web Development, but I couldn't afford the tuition and at the time I was barely sustaining myself from the Walmart job I was working.    
    <br><br>
        LaunchCode was brought to my attention sometime during August of 2021 and the tuition has been incredible if not unbelieveable.
